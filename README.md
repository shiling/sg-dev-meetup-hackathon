**Why?**

[Meetup plans to start charging US$ 2 per RSVP to all attendees for meetups](https://www.meetup.com/lp/paymentchanges), which is going to make our meetups less accessible. The worst thing that could happen is fragmentation of our meetups across different event hosting / social media platforms that makes it difficult for the community to discover their kakis. So let's get together and work fast to build a common platform to ensure that our developer meetups are discoverable! Let's w**hack** ah!
